# puzzle_reasoning

Boolean encoding of multiple puzzle games, and defining invariants for some of their unsolvable levels
The games are in particular:

* [Rush hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)), solvable levels directly from https://github.com/fogleman/rush, unsolvable levels generated with a derived code
* [Sokoban](http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Solver_Statistics#XSokoban_Test_Suite), the example unsolvable level is a modified level 26 from XSokoban
* [Ricochet Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_Robot), unsolvable levels generated by [Mikoláš Janota](https://github.com/MikolasJanota)
